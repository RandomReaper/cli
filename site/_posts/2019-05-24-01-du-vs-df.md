title: '`df` vs `du` - where my free disk space is gone?'

The well kwnown [`df`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/df.1.html){:.external}(for disk free)
and [`du`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/du.1.html){:.external}(for disk use)
are used to request disk usage. ***But they don't always tell the same story***.

Before going further, don't forget the `ncurses` based version of `du` : [`ncdu`](#ncdu).

## Something has eaten my disk space and I can't find what!
I somehow manage a server for a friend who has a small business, well *somehow*,
because I used to manage it, but since there is nothing to manage, I almost
forget about it.

This server runs `ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS` (yes a **9 years old** release,
unsupported since 2015), runs a plethora of services
(directory/file/printing/telephony/fax/snmp/imap/virtual machines/VPN/...) and
runs flawlessly, and as we say in engineering, **If it works, don't touch it!**.

But this week, my friend called me **twice** saying system partition was full.
This is the biggest flaw of this server, the system partition is a little bit
small and is filled (mainly by the log files).
[`logrotate`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/logrotate.8.html){:.external}
may not be configured as well as it should.

Ok, the disk is full, now what?

### Diagnostic

First of all :  `df -h /`
```
user@server:~$ df -h /
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/md0              4.6G  4.6G  0.0G  100% /
user@server:~$
```
Then : `sudo du -sxh /`
```
user@server:~$ sudo du -xsh /
3.3G	/
user@server:~$
```
So `df` says "4.6G used" and `du` tells "3.3G used", why? Because some files may
be deleted but still in use by other programs (see that
[excellent answer on unix.stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/68532/130000){:.external}).

So let's try `sudo lsof -s -nP +L1`:
```
...
imap     3862      XXX   14u   REG    9,0        592  0    132629 /var/mail/indexes/XXX/.Deleted Messages/dovecot.index (deleted)
imap    11242    XXXXX    7u   REG    9,0    1073712  0    137771 /var/mail/indexes/XXXXX/.Sent/dovecot.index (deleted)
openvpn 23678 nobody      1w   REG    9,0 1369666431  0    131769 /var/log/openvpn (deleted)
apache2 13815 www-data    9w   REG   0,17          0  0 369358297 /var/run/apache2/ssl_mutex (deleted)
apache2 13833 www-data    9w   REG   0,17          0  0 369358297 /var/run/apache2/ssl_mutex (deleted)
imap    25994    XXXXX    7u   REG    9,0       1296  0    131647 /var/mail/indexes/XXXXX/.INBOX/dovecot.index (deleted)
...
```

So `/var/log/openvpn` has been deleted, but it's still used by `openvpn` and
**it still consumes 1369666431 bytes (1.27 GiB) on the disk!**. It may be
possible to truncate the file while the `openvpn` server use it, but I just
restarted the `openvpn` server and now `df` and `du` now agree.

```
user@server:~$ df -h /
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/md0              4.6G  3.3G  1.3G  71% /
user@server:~$ sudo du -sxh /
3.3G	/
user@server:~$
```

Some space has been freed, I have reconfigured `openvpn` to be less verbose,
`logrotate` to rotate `openvpn`'s log file, and now I can once more forget this
server, **Great success !**

## `ncdu` - a tool for finding your big files
<a name="ncdu"></a>
[`ncdu`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/ncdu.1.html){:.external}
is the command line equivalent of gnome's disk analyser ([baobab](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Baobab){:.external}),
or not to name it, WinDirStat.

Sample output of `ncdu -x /`
```
