Tired of waiting one second when opening an attachement from [Thunderbird](/tag/thunderbird.html)?

This annoying delay introduced for *security* purpose can be disable in the `Config Editor`.

Got to `Edit` > `Preferences` > `Advanced` > `Config Editor...` and set `security.dialog_enable_delay` to `0`.
