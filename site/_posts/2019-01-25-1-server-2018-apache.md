Many services I use have a web interface, so here is my *basic* [apache](/tag/apache.html)
setup. When I say *basic*, but I mean apache with https, [http/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2){:.external}, `mysql` and `phpmyadmin`...

**This post has been updated**, since I changed my mind on http, changed my
use of `certbot` and started using virtual hosts (not really by choice).

### Services
On my home server, a web interface is available for:

| Service       | Description                         | Type            | Related tag
| -             | -                                   | -               |
| backuppc      | rsync based on disk backup          | web-app/perl    | -
| tvheadend     | TV streaming and recording server   | webserver       | [tvheadend](/tag/tvheadend.html)
| zabbix        | network monitoring                  | web-app/php     | [zabbix](/tag/zabbix.html)
| phpmyadmin    | web interface for mysql             | web-app/php     | [mysql](/tag/mysql.html)
| grafana       | data visualization and monitoring   | webserver       | [grafana](/tag/grafana.html)
| weewx         | weather station software            | generated files | TBD
| syncthing     | distributed file syncthing          | webserver       | [syncthing](/tag/syncthing.html)
| jenkins		| continuous integration			  | webserver		| TBD
| gogs			| git services						  | webserver		| TBD
| portainer     | docker management                   | webserver       | TBD

*If you have seen my previous post, you may have seen that the list continues
growing.*

Apparently the grafana, tvheadend, jenkins, gogs, syncthing and portainer guys
thinks it's a good idea to include a webserver... Please don't, and here is why (IMHO):
 * The http/https ports are already used by another program.
 * There is already a lot of good opensource web servers, the time invested in
   your integrated web server could have been better spent.
 * Most of the problems related to the security can be delegated to the existing
   existing web server.
 * A person that is able to setup grafana, tvheadend, jenkins, gogs, syncthing
 or portainer is clearly able to install a webserver. Please have a look at
 phpmyadmin, it's so easy to setup on apache.

### Why apache?

 There are plenty of opensource webservers, but I've chosen [apache httpd](/tag/apache.html)
 mainly for two reasons:
  * I know how to use it for years.
  * I don't even know how to pronounce [`nginx`](https://nginx.org/){:.external}.

### Getting rid of `http` (in favor of `https`)
I don't want to run services on `http` since it's not encrypted. Using both
`http` and `https` with the same configuration and using the same services is
possible, but I'm **strongly against it**.
If `http` is enable, you may put accidentally your credentials in clear on the
network.

It's common practice to redirect `http` traffic to `https`, this may be
comfortable to the end user, but you may still send your credentials in clear
over the network.

With `http` disable, your unencrypted credentials won't go beyond the browser or
the command line.

### `http/2`
For performance reasons I want to enable [`http/2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2){:.external},
and this will affect which apache mpm to enable.

## Domain names
`https` will link a domain name to a web server, and since I don't want to deal
with self-signed certificates, I use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/){:.external}
certificates.

*If you don't know or don't remember what a `A record` is or if you need a small
refresh on DNS, feel free to read [this interesting article](https://webhostinggeeks.com/guides/domains/){:.external}.*

Let say I own **example.com** and **example.org** (example.com and example.org are
reserved for documentation like this, more on
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example.com){:.external} and
[RFC 2606](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606){:.external}).

* The DNS for example.org and example.com is managed by my domain name registrar.
* **example.org** points to (the `A record`) a website hosted somewhere on the Internet.
* **example.com** points to (the `A record`) a website hosted somewhere else the Internet.
* **foo.example.org** point to my home router.
  * Since I don't want to pay for a static IP, my IP is dynamic, I use the
    [afraid.org](https://freedns.afraid.org/){:.external} service to make my
    dynamic address resolvable (see this [post](/dynamic-dns-afraid.html) for
    how I update the address).
  * I have delegated the control of **foo.example.org** to **afraid.org**, by
    setting the `NS record` at my domain name registrar:
    ```config
    # extract of the DNS record for example.org
    ...
    foo 10800 IN NS ns1.afraid.org.
    foo 10800 IN NS ns2.afraid.org.
    foo 10800 IN NS ns3.afraid.org.
    foo 10800 IN NS ns4.afraid.org.
    ...
    ```
    Added **foo.example.org** in the **afraid.org** web interface, then added a
    dynamic host.
* **bar.example.com** and **baz.example.com** points to **foo.example.org**,
  (`CNAME record` at my registrar):
  ```
  # extract of the DNS record for example.com
  ...
  bar 10800 IN CNAME foo.example.org.
  baz 10800 IN CNAME foo.example.org.
  ...
  ```

# Install
My router redirects connections from http and https ports to my server.

## apache
```
sudo apt-get install -y apache2 libapache2-mod-php php7.2-fpm
```
### Enable https (and http2) and disable http
1. Enable/disable modules/sites:
    ```
    sudo a2enmod proxy_fcgi setenvif
    sudo a2enmod proxy
    sudo a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
    sudo a2enconf php7.2-fpm
    sudo a2dismod mpm_prefork
    sudo a2enmod mpm_event
    sudo a2enmod http2
    sudo a2enmod ssl
    sudo a2enmod headers
    sudo a2ensite default-ssl
    sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
    ```
1. Config
  Edit the `/etc/apache2/ports.conf`, disable port 80:
    ```
    #Listen 80

    <IfModule ssl_module>
          Listen localhost:443
          Listen 10.13.9.40:443
    </IfModule>

    <IfModule mod_gnutls.c>
          Listen localhost:443
          Listen 10.13.9.40:443
    </IfModule>
    ```
1. Restart apache2
   ```
   sudo apache2ctl configtest && sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```
1. Verify that http is disable and https has bad certificate:
    ```
    wget -O /dev/null http://foo.example.org
    --2019-01-25 11:24:02--  http://foo.example.org/
    Resolving foo.example.org (foo.example.org)... 127.0.0.1
    Connecting to foo.example.org (foo.example.org)|127.0.0.1|:80... failed: Connection refused.

    wget -O /dev/null https://foo.example.org
    --2019-01-25 11:24:08--  https://foo.example.org/
    Resolving foo.example.org (foo.example.org)... 127.0.0.1
    Connecting to foo.example.org (foo.example.org)|127.0.0.1|:443... connected.
    ERROR: cannot verify foo.example.org's certificate, issued by ‘CN=ubuntu’:
      Self-signed certificate encountered.
    ERROR: no certificate subject alternative name matches
    	requested host name foo.example.org.
    To connect to foo.example.org insecurely, use `--no-check-certificate'.
    ```

### Install the certificates
1. Install `certbot`:
    ```
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y certbot
    ```
1. Configure `certbot`, this will request and install certificates, `cron` will
   manage certificate renewal (automagically configured). During the validation
   `certbot` will run it's own webserver on port 80, and `let's encrypt` server
   must be able to access it.
     ```
     sudo certbot --standalone certonly -d foo.example.org -d bar.example.com -d baz.example.com
     Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
     Plugins selected: Authenticator standalone, Installer None
     Enter email address (used for urgent renewal and security notices) (Enter 'c' to
     cancel): me@example.org

     ```
### Enable the new certificates and h2
1. Edit /etc/apache/site-available/default-ssl.conf

    ```
    <VirtualHost _default_:443>
    Protocols h2 http/1.1
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    ServerName foo.example.org
    ServerAlias localhost

    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.example.org/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.example.org/privkey.pem
    Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf
    Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" env=HTTPS
    ...
    ```
1. restart apache
    ```
    sudo apache2ctl configtest && sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```
1. Verify that http is diable and https has a valid certificate:
    ```
    wget -O /dev/null http://foo.example.org
    --2019-01-25 11:24:02--  http://foo.example.org/
    Resolving foo.example.org (foo.example.org)... 127.0.0.1
    Connecting to foo.example.org (foo.example.org)|127.0.0.1|:80... failed: Connection refused.

    wget -O /dev/null https://foo.example.org
    --2019-01-25 11:32:50--  https://foo.example.org/
    Resolving foo.example.org (foo.example.org)... 127.0.0.1
    Connecting to foo.example.org (foo.example.org)|127.0.0.1|:443... connected.

    ```

## mysql + automysqlbackup
```
sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server automysqlbackup
```
mysql use system password for root, but root has no system password, so let's
use mysql password for root:
```
sudo mysql -u root mysql
UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
SET PASSWORD FOR root@'localhost' = PASSWORD('MyCoolPassword');
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;
```

## phpmyadmin
```
sudo apt-get install -y phpmyadmin
```
 - Http server : apache2
 - Configuring phpmyadmin : Yes
 - Password for phpmyadmin : MyCoolPassword

### Testing
Open this URL in your favorite browser : https://YOUR_SERVER_IP_HERE/phpmyadmin,
then login a `root`/`MyCoolPassword`.

### `mysql` backups
You may have noticed that `automysqlbackup` is installed. It will periodically
backup all mysql databases into `/var/lib/automysqlbackup`.

It is configurable by modifying `/etc/default/automysqlbackup`.

Here is some recommendations extracted from the `automysqlbackup` script:

```
# Daily Backups are rotated weekly..
# Weekly Backups are run by default on Saturday Morning when
# cron.daily scripts are run...Can be changed with DOWEEKLY setting..
# Weekly Backups are rotated on a 5 week cycle..
# Monthly Backups are run on the 1st of the month..
# Monthly Backups are NOT rotated automatically...
# It may be a good idea to copy Monthly backups offline or to another
```

# Configuring virtual hosts (for bar.example.com and baz.example.com)
1. Create the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/bar-ssl.conf:

    ```
    <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    	<VirtualHost _default_:443>
    		ServerName bar.example.com
    		ServerAlias baz.example.com
    		Protocols h2 http/1.1
    		ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

    		SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.example.org/fullchain.pem
    		SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.example.org/privkey.pem
    		Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf
    		Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" env=HTTPS

    		DocumentRoot /SOMEWHERE/
    		<Directory "/SOMEWHERE">
    			Require all granted
    			Options Indexes MultiViews
    		</directory>
    	</VirtualHost>
    </IfModule>
    ```

# Proxy example - `tvheadend`
No that we've got a working https server, let's map the `tvheadend` service behind
it. I have chosen `tvheadend` as an example because it uses websockets.
1. Edit /etc/apache/site-available/bar-ssl.conf:
    ```
    <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    	<VirtualHost _default_:443>
    		ServerName bar.example.com
            ServerAlias baz.example.com
    		Protocols h2 http/1.1
    		ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

    		SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.example.org/fullchain.pem
    		SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.example.org/privkey.pem
    		Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf
    		Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" env=HTTPS

    		DocumentRoot /SOMEWHERE/
    		<Directory "/SOMEWHERE">
    			Require all granted
    			Options Indexes MultiViews
    		</directory>

    		ProxyRequests   on

    		# Map /hts/comet/ws before /hts, because the first proxy directive
    		# matched will be used.
    		# Since hts will manage it's own users, anybody is permitted access
    		# (Require all granted)

    		# Web sockets
    		ProxyPass /hts/comet/ws ws://localhost:9981/hts/comet/ws retry=0
    		<Location /hts/comet/ws>
    			ProxyPassReverse	ws://localhost:9981/hts/comet/ws
    			Require all granted
    		</Location>

    		# Web interface
    		ProxyPass	/hts http://localhost:9981/hts retry=0
    		<Location /hts>
    			ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:9981/hts
    			Require all granted
    		</Location>

    		# Request not matching any proxy (for intance /) will still go to
    		# DocumentRoot

    	</VirtualHost>
    </IfModule>
    ```
2. Reload apache
    This time a simple reload is sufficient:
    ```
    sudo apache2ctl configtest && sudo systemctl restart reload
    ```
3. Enjoy the `tvheadend` web interface now available at `https://bar.example.com/example`!

# To be continued
Now that the infrastructure is in place, let's do something with it : monitor system health with [zabbix and grafana](/server-18.04-zabbix-grafana.html), then [making grafana faster using compression](/apache-gzip-grafana-faster.html).
