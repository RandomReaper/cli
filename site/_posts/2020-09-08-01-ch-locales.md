[ubuntu](/tag/ubuntu.html) (like most GNU/Linux distributions) is trying hard to
speak your language, even in the console, and not only the language, but also
number formatting.

For instance:
 * 15,000 is 15 for an European<sup>[\*1](#_nb1)</sup> and 15E3 for an American.
 * 09/08 may be September 8 or August 9<sup>[\*2](#_nb2)</sup>.

## Background
Programs use [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable){:.external}
to try to *translate* program output. Those environment variables are named `LANGUAGE`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_*` (`LC_TIME`, `LC_MONETARY`, ...) and `LANG`.

Those variables contains the name of the [`locale`](/tag/locale.html).

Example :
```
echo LC_TIME=$LC_TIME
LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8
```

```
LC_TIME=ls -lh /dev/ttyS0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 Aug 10 11:58 /dev/ttyS0
LC_TIME=fr_CH.UTF-8 ls -lh /dev/ttyS0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 ao√ª 10 11:58 /dev/ttyS0
```

## Configuring the locales
### Using system tools
Select the local you need.
```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

### Manual setup
Edit `/etc/default/locale` as you want:
```
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_NUMERIC="fr_CH.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_DK.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="fr_CH.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="fr_CH.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="fr_CH.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="fr_CH.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="fr_CH.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="fr_CH.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="fr_CH.UTF-8"
```

Edit `/etc/locale.gen`, uncomment the locales you need:
```
#...
# de_CH ISO-8859-1
de_CH.UTF-8 UTF-8
# de_DE ISO-8859-1
#...
# en_DK.ISO-8859-15 ISO-8859-15
en_DK.UTF-8 UTF-8
# en_GB ISO-8859-1
#...
# en_US.ISO-8859-15 ISO-8859-15
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
# en_ZA ISO-8859-1
#...
# fr_CH ISO-8859-1
fr_CH.UTF-8 UTF-8
# fr_FR ISO-8859-1
#...
```

Generate the locales with `sudo locale-gen`, if all `en` locales are generated, you may want to remove `/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local/en`.
```
Generating locales (this might take a while)...
  de_CH.UTF-8... done
  en_DK.UTF-8... done
  en_US.UTF-8... done
  fr_CH.UTF-8... done
Generation complete.
```

### Remote locales or `perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings`

You may have seen that kind of warning:
```bash
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
 LANGUAGE = "en_US:en",
 LC_ALL = (unset),
 LC_TIME = "fr_CH.UTF-8",
 LC_MONETARY = "fr_CH.UTF-8",
 LC_ADDRESS = "fr_CH.UTF-8",
 LC_TELEPHONE = "fr_CH.UTF-8",
 LC_NAME = "fr_CH.UTF-8",
 LC_MEASUREMENT = "fr_CH.UTF-8",
 LC_IDENTIFICATION = "fr_CH.UTF-8",
 LC_NUMERIC = "fr_CH.UTF-8",
 LC_PAPER = "fr_CH.UTF-8",
 LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
    are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to a fallback locale ("en_US.UTF-8").
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
```
It is usually caused by a connection through [ssh](/tag/ssh.html), where the host has configured some locales that are unavailable on the remote system.

#### Solution #1 : add the missing locales
0. Connect to the remote host
0. Edit `/etc/locale.gen`, add the missing locales
0. Generate the locales using `sudo locale-gen`

#### Solution #2.1 : configure your local ssh not to send locale-related environment variables
0. Edit `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` (or your user's `~/.ssh/config`) and add :
```
SendEnv LANG LC_*
```

#### Solution #2.2 : configure the remote system ssh not to accept locale-related environment variables
0. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (dont' forget the **d**)  and add :
```
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*
```

While you're configuring ssh, have a look at [`ssh` keepalive](/pages/ssh-keepalive.html).
